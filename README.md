# UFO Sightings with JavaScript 
## Overview 
***Background***
Specifically, we helped Dana create a webpage about UFO Sightings using JavaScript to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Throughout the process, we learned about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We specifically learned how to:

- Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
- Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

***Purpose***
The purpose of this challenge assignment is to help Dana's webpage and dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Instead of filtering by just the date, we are to create filters that work for city, state, country and shape as well.
